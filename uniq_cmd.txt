The uniq cmd is used to omit repeated values or strings in a text or files with lists. 

The cmd is invoked as such:
    uniq <filename>
    
There are arguments that are useful to using the cmd, such as -c and -d.

       -c, --count
              prefix lines by the number of occurrences
	The cmd above is combined with uniq as such: 
	
	uniq -c <filename>              
	
     The result of the cmd above is:
	
      1 	Atlanta
      1 	Austin
      2 	Boston
      1 	Charlotte
      1 	Chicago
      1 	Columbus
      2 	Dallas
      2 	Denver
      1 	El Paso
      1 	Ft. Lauderdale
      1 	Houston
      2 	Las Vegas
      1 	Los Angeles
      3 	Miami
      1 	New York City
      1 	Orlando
      1 	Philadelphia
      1 	Pittsburgh
      1 	Providence
      1 	San Antonio
      1 	St. Louis
      1 	Washington, D.C.


       -d, --repeated
              only print duplicate lines, one for each group
              
      The cmd above is combined with uniq as such:
      
      uniq -d <filename>
      
      The result is as such:
      
      	Boston
	Dallas
	Denver
	Las Vegas
	Miami

      
     A similar command prints all of the duplicate lines instead of how results 
     are with -d is with the following combined cmd:
     
     uniq -D <filename>
     
     The results are a such:
     
     	Boston
	Boston
	Dallas
	Dallas
	Denver
	Denver
	Las Vegas
	Las Vegas
	Miami
	Miami
	Miami
	
    Another useful combination of cmd lines give a result of all of the unique items
    that are listed on the file once:
    
    uniq -u <filename>
    
    The results are as such:
    
    	Atlanta
	Austin
	Charlotte
	Chicago
	Columbus
	El Paso
	Ft. Lauderdale
	Houston
	Los Angeles
	New York City
	Orlando
	Philadelphia
	Pittsburgh
	Providence
	San Antonio
	St. Louis
	Washington, D.C.
